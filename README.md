# High-Fidelity-Mockup
This is a high fidelity mockup of a market place for mobile devices. Made to showcase an example of how can a mockup can be.  It is a continuation of the los fidelity mockup

Main Colors

My first design, the low fidelity mockup, was raw and in my opinion unfinished. This design tries to expand and tell better how a market place application can be. My initial research led to see how apps like Mercado Libre and Amazon work.
