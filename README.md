(1) Main menu.
<br>
My first design, the low fidelity mockup, was raw and in my opinion unfinished. This design tries to expand and tell better how a market place application can be. My initial research led to see how apps like Mercado Libre and Amazon work. There is a second log in button, this tries to invite you. The text above it states that having an account you will have all the <em>experience</em>.
<br><br>
(2)Log in.
<br>
You go straight to the point. Enter user, password, and ready to go. If you don't have an account you can enter to the link to create an account.
<br><br>
(3)Creatin an account.
<br>
Creating an account is easy. Enter your name, e-mail address, and a password to associate with the account. Steps like adding where you live are related to the address settings, it'll be explained.
<br><br>
(4)Pin code.
<br>
To check that you are a real person, and you didn't typed incorrectly your e-mail. A mail is sent to you with a pin code, that code is needed to activate the account. Now, that mail is a gateway whenever you need to do something related to your account, but you don't remember your password.
<br><br>
(5)using the searchBar.
<br>
By using the searchBar you can find a specific product you are looking for. Eg. On image(5) the legendary plush was searched. By seeing the one you are ok with you can add it to your cart.
<br><br>
(6)Empty Cart.
<br>
If you don't have anything in your cart a message is diplayed. "Your cart is empty".
<br><br>
(7)Shopping Cart.
<br>
This is a version of a shopping cart with products in it. At the top you can see the subtotal of all your products and down below you can see individually the price of your products.
<br><br>
(8)Checkout.
<br>
For this section I didn't have a clear idea of what to do. My first concept was just having a section where it asks if your address is correct. As well, I wanted a similar section for the payment method. A second thought was to give the security to the user that if something wrong happens a copy of the receipt is sent to the associated e-mail address.
<br><br>
(9)Account Setting.
<br>
In the navbar, after you log in, the log in button changes to the account button. By clicking it you can check your account settings. Options like the address are located here beacuase a a user can be in one home and then move to another country, state, etc. That is why when you make an account you don't need to specify your nationality. Similar case with the payments methods, one person can use a different variety of methods and cards to pay it is not limited just to one.
